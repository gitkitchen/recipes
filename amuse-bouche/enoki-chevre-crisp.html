<b>Recipe: Enoki and ch√®vre crisp amuse-bouche</b>. To make crackers, heat oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly dust with flour. Combine 1 cup flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 cup grated parmesan and 4 tbsp butter. Add about 1/4 cup cream; continue to add liquid a teaspoon at a time, until mixture holds together but is not sticky. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface until thin, adding flour as needed. Transfer sheet of dough to prepared baking sheet (drape it over rolling pin to make it easier). Score lightly with a sharp knife, pizza cutter or a pastry wheel if you want to break crackers into squares or rectangles later on. Sprinkle with coarse salt and/or another topping if you like (e.g. minced garlic, poppy seeds). Bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk 1/4 cup goat cheese, 1 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp milk, 1/2 tsp vinegar, 1/4 tsp salt until fluffy. Fry enoki mushrooms (or maitake, oyster, or another interesting kind) in butter. To assemble, place a dollop of the whipped goat cheese on the cracker, place the mushroom, sprinkle with black pepper, and top with a herb leaf (e.g. lavender).
